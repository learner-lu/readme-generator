## Attention

- The README file is **not** an offical template, it   mainly derives from my experience when I was browsing Github's excellent open source projects' README.md file.
- The format of this README template mainly suits for machine learning or deep learning paper with its code published on Github.
- The source code is in [here](https://github.com/learner-lu/readme-generator), if you meet any issue or problem please contact me.
